# Wazuh Deployment — continuous-workflow pivot

## Current SONIC design lock

The ten Wazuh lessons now use ordered beginner walkthroughs from `app/wazuh-walkthroughs.ts`: named machine/application/account, exact clicks or commands, option explanations, expected outcomes, explicit branch/wait checkpoints and evidence capture. They replace the former bulk command/procedure presentation for those lessons. The dashboard layout and completion IDs are unchanged. The walkthrough standard is the baseline for future lesson work; do not substitute “follow the documentation” for the actual steps of the main lab path. Environment-specific trust/authorization decisions remain explicit stop conditions.

The dashboard retains its approved layout with a graphite, silver, tactical-red and limited-cyan palette. The globe uses silver geography, red instrumentation and selected cyan connectivity. The VNet lesson (`network-plan-v2`) is the representative calm workspace. See [SONIC-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md](SONIC-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md) for semantic color rules and scope.

The 30 implemented preparation lessons total **2–3 hours hands-on** for a learner with a functioning workstation/Azure environment. Build/access: **87–130 minutes**; file delivery: **10–15 minutes**; baseline/rollback: **23–35 minutes**. Optional detailed reading is **80–150 minutes separately**; passive Azure provisioning/deallocation waits are **11–25 minutes separately**, varying with the environment. These are planning estimates, not measured completion times. All lesson, stage and remaining-work estimates use `app/course-timing.ts`. Planned stages have no invented duration.

Current validation: 24 automated tests and lint pass. Dashboard browser checks cover real completion, START/CONTINUE/REVIEW, cross-tab updates and 390–1600px layouts. The design was approved; ten Wazuh deployment, validation, fault and recovery lessons are now implemented.

The existing Milestone 2 application is retained: dashboard, styling, terminal blocks, SSH-key visualization, named account `rexuser`, challenges, and browser progress. The first major lab is now one continuous two-system administration scenario. No advanced storage prerequisite is placed before Wazuh.

## Old roadmap versus new roadmap

Previously: Windows/Azure/SSH foundations → deep storage → identity/permissions → artifact transfer → packages/services → networking → Wazuh manager → Wazuh agent → troubleshooting → recovery.

Now: two-host build/SSH with practical build-time storage → harmless SCP/SFTP transfer → installer literacy, inventory and explicit pre-change rollback → Wazuh central server/dashboard → endpoint agent/service discovery/communication → dashboard check-in and validation → a controlled communication failure → recovery and documentation. Advanced topics follow that complete scenario.

The full 22-step user workflow is visible in the roadmap. Azure requires an existing public key before final VM creation: the lessons stage VM/storage choices first, then restrict/authorize SSH and submit the build. This prerequisite is explicit, not a reason to use password login or expose SSH broadly.

## Implemented now

Thirty detailed tasks across three ready stages:

1. **Build and administer both RHEL systems** — all retained foundations plus a two-host budget/architecture, build-time disks/partitions/filesystems/mounts, manager VM provisioning, `lsblk`/`findmnt`/`df -h`/`df -i`, and separate verified manager access.
2. **Deliver and verify a harmless file** — Windows text/hash creation, SCP, remote `pwd`/`ls -l`/`file`/`sha256sum` checks, and interactive SFTP with local-versus-remote paths. No private key is transferred.
3. **Prepare the software change** — script/RPM/archive/repository methods, package/process/unit inventories, retained baseline, explicit rollback/snapshot/backup checkpoint, vSphere comparisons, and deallocation of both hosts.

Every new task has scenario, objective, enterprise rationale, change scope, commands and argument explanations, expected result, verification, failure causes, ordered troubleshooting, rollback, and a Your Turn challenge. Commands for different shells are separated into labeled blocks. Installer/discovery examples with unknown future names remain commented references, not executable Wazuh instructions.

The central VM is `rhel9-manager-01` (manager + indexer + dashboard role); the retained endpoint is `rhel9-lab-01`. Both use `rexuser`. The central sizing plan follows current Wazuh all-in-one guidance (at least 4 vCPU/8 GiB and adequate storage for the small lab); it does not reuse the lighter endpoint size. Real regional prices, licensing, and supported versions must be reviewed before provisioning/installing. No Azure resources are created by the app.

## Deployment, validation and recovery lessons

Five subsequent main-lab stages now contain ten lessons with completion controls: central installation, agent installation/service discovery, check-in/validation, the ordered communication failure investigation, and recovery/documentation. Each new task begins unverified. Expandable stage specifications remain available as acceptance references.

The troubleshooting exercise is designed around a reversible wrong-manager-address fault after a working check-in. It covers installed package → service → logs → address → DNS → route → ports → NSGs → guest firewall → SELinux/audit evidence → application configuration → central enrollment, then targeted restoration and retesting. Security controls are not disabled as a default fix.

After those stages: advanced LVM/storage; Linux identity/permissions/packages/scripts/processes/systemd; networking/DNS/firewall/SELinux; STIG/SCC/SCAP with Windows export and STIG Viewer; ACAS/Tenable Security Center; hardened RHEL baselines and reusable Azure/vSphere images/templates.

## Progress preservation

All 18 Milestone 2 IDs remain present. The version-2 browser storage schema and key are unchanged: **no new migration or reset is needed**. Existing completion follows the task ID when reordered. Twelve additional tasks use new IDs and start unverified, so the available-task percentage may decrease while every old completion remains retained. Reused foundation tasks cover the original endpoint; new host-specific tasks separately verify manager work.

The original milestone-one numeric-history migration still works. Tests verify old completions survive and cannot auto-complete new work. Browser/origin-specific storage, cross-tab synchronization, invalid-data filtering, and session fallback are retained.

## Files changed or added

- `app/course.ts` — retained foundation content, contextual updates, references, new lesson fields, and ordered composition.
- `app/course-roadmap.ts` — **new**: stage membership, 22-step scenario, planned main-lab exercises, and later deep dives.
- `app/lab-lessons.ts` — **new**: 12 substantial two-host, storage, transfer, inventory, and recovery lessons.
- `app/page.tsx` — existing interface gains stage-aware navigation/completion, planned exercise details, vSphere callouts, and separate follow-up terminal blocks.
- `app/lesson-visuals.tsx` — retained SSH-key visual; architecture and protocol captions reflect the two-host scenario.
- `app/globals.css` — matching styles for callouts, follow-up blocks, and planned exercise details; original design remains.
- `tests/course.test.mjs` — progression/order, stage boundaries, transfer safety, installer examples, and retained progress regression checks.
- `tsconfig.json` — permits explicit TypeScript imports for shared curriculum modules used by Node tests and the app.
- `README.md` — roadmap, implementation boundaries, verification, and preview instructions.

No dependency or lockfile changes. Existing progress model/store files are unchanged.

## Preview and validation

Use Node 22.13+ and npm. If needed run `npm ci`; then `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:3000. `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` validate the application. `npm run start` serves the built Worker locally.

Application lint, all 24 tests, and the production build pass. Browser verification covers lesson rendering, completion routing and responsive layouts. Live Azure provisioning and RHEL/Wazuh command execution were not performed. Optional WebMCP navigation is still feature-detected and was not exercised in a supported WebMCP context.

The inherited exclusions for untouched `components/ui` and `hooks/use-mobile.ts` remain unchanged. No weaker rules or new exclusions were added. The pinned starter's previously reported dependency advisories were not resolved by this curriculum change; audit before broader rollout.

## Wazuh milestone — implemented

Ten new lessons now teach the central-installation and endpoint-agent portion on the prepared VMs: choose and record a currently supported stable Wazuh release; verify official artifacts and revalidate recovery checkpoints; install central manager/indexer/dashboard and inspect discovered services; constrain and verify HTTPS access; inspect/transfer/install the agent RPM; discover its actual service from package/unit evidence; configure private manager communication/enrollment; and prove current dashboard check-in with correlated logs and a harmless event. The controlled wrong-manager-address exercise, approved recovery/validation and final documentation are included. The course now has 40 lessons across eight available stages, with advanced deep dives still planned. Existing completion IDs are preserved; completion of preparation routes to the first Wazuh lesson. Deployment and recovery add an estimated 76–115 minutes hands-on; the original preparation remains 120–180 minutes. Optional reading and passive waits remain separate.

The app teaches the work; it does not execute installers or provision the learner's infrastructure. Earlier ZIP files remain historical exports. The workspace source is current; historical ZIP exports do not contain this milestone.
